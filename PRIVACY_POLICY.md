# Privacy Policy for TimeFill

**Last Updated: October 13, 2025**

## Introduction

TimeFill ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how TimeFill handles your information.

## The Simple Truth

**TimeFill collects NO data. Period.**

We don't collect, store, transmit, or share any of your personal information. Ever.

## Data Storage

All data you create in TimeFill (countdown events, settings, preferences) is stored **exclusively on your device**. This data:

- Never leaves your device
- Is not uploaded to any servers
- Is not backed up to our servers
- Is not shared with third parties
- Is not used for analytics or advertising

## What We DON'T Collect

- ❌ No personal information (name, email, phone number)
- ❌ No location data
- ❌ No usage analytics
- ❌ No crash reports
- ❌ No advertising identifiers
- ❌ No device information
- ❌ No contact list access
- ❌ No calendar content (only event metadata you choose to import)
- ❌ No tracking cookies or pixels
- ❌ No third-party analytics (no Google Analytics, Firebase, etc.)

## Permissions Used

TimeFill requests only the permissions necessary for core functionality:

### Notifications (Optional)
- **Purpose**: Send you reminders for your countdown events
- **How it works**: Scheduled locally on your device
- **Your control**: You can enable/disable in iOS Settings or within the app
- **Data**: Notification content never leaves your device

### Calendar Access (Optional)
- **Purpose**: Let you import events from your calendar as countdowns
- **How it works**: You select which events to import; we read only the events you choose
- **Data**: Only event name and date are copied to the app's local storage
- **Your control**: You can deny calendar access and still use the app fully

### Widgets
- **Purpose**: Display your countdowns on your home screen
- **How it works**: Data shared between app and widget using App Groups (still local to your device)
- **Data**: Widget data never leaves your device

## Third-Party Services

TimeFill uses **ZERO** third-party services. No:
- Analytics providers
- Advertising networks
- Crash reporting services
- Cloud storage services
- Authentication services

## Data Deletion

Since all data is stored only on your device:
- Delete the app = all data is immediately removed from your device
- Clear app data in iOS Settings = all data is removed
- We don't have any data about you to delete from servers (because we don't have servers)

## Children's Privacy

TimeFill does not collect any data from anyone, including children under 13. The app is safe for all ages.

## Changes to This Policy

If we ever change how we handle data (though we have no plans to), we will:
1. Update this policy
2. Update the "Last Updated" date
3. Notify users through an app update

## Your Rights (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

Since we collect zero data:
- Right to access: There's no data to access
- Right to deletion: There's no data to delete
- Right to portability: There's no data to port
- Right to correction: There's no data to correct

You have complete control because everything is on your device.

## Open Source

TimeFill's code is available for review. You can verify our privacy claims by examining the source code.

## Contact

If you have questions about this privacy policy:

**Email**: agbolaboridunsin@gmail.com

Please note: Since we collect no data, there's nothing for us to help you access, delete, or modify on our end. All your data lives exclusively on your device.

## Summary

**TimeFill is offline-first and privacy-first by design.**

- ✅ All data stored locally on your device
- ✅ No servers, no cloud, no backend
- ✅ No tracking or analytics
- ✅ No ads or third-party services
- ✅ Open and transparent

Your countdown events are yours alone. We can't see them, we don't want to see them, and we've designed the app so we couldn't see them even if we wanted to.

That's privacy.
