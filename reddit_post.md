# TimeFill Update: Custom Color Picker & Bug Fixes

Hey everyone! Just pushed some updates to TimeFill and wanted to share what's new.

For those unfamiliar, **TimeFill** is a privacy-first countdown tracker for iOS that visualizes time like a battery charging up. Track birthdays, trips, deadlines - anything important - with a beautiful heatmap grid that fills as the event approaches. Everything stays 100% offline on your device.

## What's New

**üé® Custom Color Picker**

The big one: I've added a full custom color picker! You can now choose any color you want for your countdowns, way beyond the preset themes. The picker includes:
- Full color spectrum selector
- Eyedropper tool to pick colors from anywhere on screen
- Real-time preview of your countdown with the selected color

**üêõ Bug Fixes**

- Fixed color picker height issues and parent view dismissal behavior
- Resolved an annoying freeze that could happen with the eyedropper tool
- Cleaned up widget sample data for a better out-of-box experience

**üçé App Store Compliance**

Made some under-the-hood changes to ensure everything stays in line with App Store guidelines (removed some donation features to keep things simple and compliant).

---

As always, the app is **completely free** with no ads, no tracking, and no subscriptions. Your countdowns live entirely on your device.

If you haven't tried it yet, you can find it on the App Store. Would love to hear what you think!

*Available on iOS 17.0+*
